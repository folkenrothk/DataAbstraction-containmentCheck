## Experiment Design

For my experiment with `containmentcheck`, I have three research questions that I designed this systemic testing around. For each of my questions, I had to adjust the parameters to address what the question specified. 
  
For the first research question, there were three varying sizes of containers. This meant that I ran three trials with the lists, three with the tuples, and three with the sets. Of the three tests for each, one was at the container size of 50000000, 100000000, and 200000000. These container sizes were chosen due to the concept of the doubling experiment. Everything else in these runs remained constant. Due to the question specification, the value exceed the container maximum and was thus not found within the container. The maximum value of item was designated as 50000000 to have a number large enough that the program would take time to iterate through the data containers but not too large that the experiment would not be completed in a timely fashion.

For the second research question, this was constructed very similarly to the first research question. The data container types, sizes, and maximum value are the same as the first question for the same reasonings. This questions then builds on the first by searching for a value within the container. This is seen by the exceed parameter as not being fulfilled. This then causes a random number to be generated and searched for within the container.

Lastly, the third question was constructed to look at the changes caused by a small or large maximum value specified. Since this question only has two options for a changing variable, I only ran each data container type twice. Each of these runs had the item that was being searched for exceed the maximum value so that the program would have to iterate through the complete data container. I chose to have the size of the container remain constant at the size of 50000000 as that was the smallest size of other trials.

## Research Questions

RQ1. When the value exceeds the container maximum and using the `in` operator for containment checking, which data container has the least time overhead at varying sizes (50000000, 100000000, 200000000)?

RQ2. When the value does not exceed the container maximum and using the `in` operator for containment checking, which data container has the least time overhead at varying sizes (50000000, 100000000, 200000000)?

RQ3. When the value exceeds the container maximum and using the `in` operator for containment checking, do all of the containers have the least time overhead with a maximum value of 500000000 or a maximum value of 1000000000 million?

## Performance Analysis

### Empirical Evaluation

TODO: Provide at least three paragraphs that explain which containment checking
algorithm is fastest, by how much it is faster, and how you knew that it was
faster, referencing the data in the aforementioned command outputs and the data
tables to support your response. You should make sure that you answer each of
the at least three research questions that you posed in a previous section.

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!
TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

//TODO

### Analytical Evaluation

TODO: Using the provided source code for the different containment check
algorithms, your textbook, your experimental results, and any relevant online
resources that you cite in this reflection, define the worst-case time
complexity, using the big-O notation, for the three containment check
algorithms called `containment_check_tuple`, `containment_check_list`, and
`containment_check_set`. You should justify why you picked that complexity.

//TODO

## Source Code

### Describe in detail how the provided source code works

```python
number_runs = 10
number_repeats = 3
execution_times = timeit.Timer(containment_check_lambda).repeat(
    repeat=number_repeats, number=number_runs
)
```

This section of python source code begins by initalizing two variables. The first variable of `number_runs` is set as 10 and the `number_repeats` is set as 3. Stored in the variable `execution_times`, the code calls timeit to use Timer and repeat. The Timer takes the parameter containment_check_lambda which is timing the function running from start to end. The repeat takes in the two variables that were just initalized. This tells the program to run containmentcheck 10 times then repeat that 3 times. This cause us to have 3 sets of 10 runs of containmentcheck.

## Professional Development

### What is challenging about designing an experiment to evaluate an algorithm's performance?

The most challenging part about designing an experiment to evaluate an algorithm's performance is having a full enough understanding of the program. Having a decent understanding of the code you are using is critical in creating logical research questions. However, understanding a program completely leads to many experimental questions seemingly pointless to ask. This balance is important to conducting a worthwhile experiment and often requires a recursive process of developing research questions. 


### Why is it necessary to perform both an analytical and an empirical evaluation of an algorithm?

It is necessary to perform both analytical and empirical evaluations of an algorithm because they test different parts of algorithm. The analytical evalution looks at the quality and complexity of the code. This one is just analyzing the source code. Empirical evalutions use the algorithm with actual inputs. This type of evalution allows for us to excute the code and record values like runtime or space used. Doing both allows us to get a fuller picture of the algorithms we are evaluating.

### How do the empirical results suggest that you don't yet know the entire story about the performance of containment checking?

These empirical results suggest we do not yet know the entire story about containment checking because we saw that sets were the slowest throughout all of the runs. From other sources we discussed in class, sets are supposed to be the fastest. When looking at the source code through an analytical approach we can tell that the set function is actually working wiht a list that is then turned into a set. This operation is so slow that the quickness of working with the set does not outweigh the cost of making the data a set. In practice, the set is not fast enough to make up for the other necessary time costs.
